# The Go Programming Language - Exercise Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises from the book "The Go Programming Language" by Alan A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan.

## About The Project

This is a learning journey repository where I document my solutions while teaching myself Go programming. The exercises are from one of the most comprehensive books on Go, commonly known as "The Go Programming Language" or "GOPL".

## Project Structure

The repository is organized by chapters, with each directory corresponding to a specific chapter or concept from the book:

```
.
├── strings/       # String manipulation exercises
├── ...           # More chapters to come
```

## Getting Started

To run these solutions locally:

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/captbilard/The-Go-Programming-Language-Exercise-Solutions.git
cd The-Go-Programming-Language-Exercise-Solutions
```

2. Make sure you have Go installed on your system
```bash
go version
```

3. Run any solution
```bash
cd chapter-directory
go run main.go
```

## Contributing

While this is primarily a personal learning project, I welcome discussions about the solutions! If you:
- Have a more efficient solution
- Spot a bug
- Want to discuss the approach
- Have questions about any solution

Feel free to:
1. Open an issue
2. Start a discussion
3. Connect with me on LinkedIn

## Connect

I'm always happy to connect with fellow Go enthusiasts and discuss these solutions or Go programming in general. You can find me on:
